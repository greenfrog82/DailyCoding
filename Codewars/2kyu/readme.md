# [2kyu Regular Expression - Check if divisible by 0b111 (7)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56a73d2194505c29f600002d/train/python)

Create a regular expression capable of evaluating binary strings (which consist of only 1's and 0's) and determining whether the given string represents a number divisible by 7.

Note:

* Empty strings should be rejected.
* Your solution should reject strings with any character other than 0 and 1.
* No leading 0's will be tested unless the string exactly denotes 0.
