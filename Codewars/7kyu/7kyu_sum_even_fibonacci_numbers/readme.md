# [7kyu Sum Even Fibonacci Numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-even-fibonacci-numbers/go)

* Write a func named SumEvenFibonacci that takes a parameter of type int and returns a value of type int
* Generate all of the Fibonacci numbers starting with 1 and 2 and ending on the highest number before exceeding the parameter's value

Each new number in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two numbers - by starting with 1 and 2(the input could be smaller), the first 10 numbers will be:

> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

* Sum all of the even numbers you generate and return that int

Example:

>sumEvenFibonacci(8) // returns 10 by adding the even values 2 and 8


## My Solution

```python
def SumEvenFibonacci(limit):
    sum_even_fibo = fibo_num = 0
    first, second = 0, 1

    while(fibo_num < limit):
        fibo_num = first + second
        if not fibo_num % 2 and fibo_num <= limit:
            sum_even_fibo = sum_even_fibo + fibo_num
        first, second = second, fibo_num
    
    return sum_even_fibo
```

```go
func SumEvenFibonacci(limit int) int {
	sum := 2
	for first, second := 1, 2; second <= limit; first, second = second, first + second {
		if 2 < second && 0 == second % 2 {
			sum += second
		}
	}
	return sum
}
```

## Other Solution

```python
def SumEvenFibonacci(limit):
    a, b, s = 1, 1, 0
    while a <= limit:
        if not a % 2:
            s += a
        a, b = b, a + b
    return s
```
