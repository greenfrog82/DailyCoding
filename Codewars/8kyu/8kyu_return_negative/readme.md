# [Return Negative](https://www.codewars.com/kata/return-negative)

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

### Example:

```go
MakeNegative(1)    # return -1
MakeNegative(-5)   # return -5
MakeNegative(0)    # return 0
```

###Notes:

* The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
* Zero (0) can't be negative, see examples above.
