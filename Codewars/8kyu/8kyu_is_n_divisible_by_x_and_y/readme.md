# [8kyu Is n divisiable by x and y?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/is-n-divisible-by-x-and-y/train/python)

Create a function isDivisible(n, x, y) that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y. All inputs are positive, non-zero digits.

```
Example:
is_divisible(3,1,3)--> true because 3 is divisible by 1 and 3
is_divisible(12,2,6)--> true because 12 is divisible by 2 and 6
is_divisible(100,5,3)--> false because 100 is not divisible by 3
is_divisible(12,7,5)--> false because 12 is neither divisible by 7 nor 5
```

## My Solution

```python
def is_divisible(n, x, y):
    return not n % x and not n % y
```

## Other Solution

```python
def is_divisible(n, x, y):
    return n % x == n % y == 0
```
